[ ]  Planters, seedlings, earth

* The most effective wavelength for early vegetative growth is between 420 and 490 nm. 
For the highest aroma, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds content, basil is suggested to grow under 510-570 nm wavelength. 
The largest leaves and the highest moisture content were recorded, when the wavelength was between 650 and 710 nm.
